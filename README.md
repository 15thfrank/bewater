Bewater -  a productivity app

This is based on the consistent and unrelenting nature of water as experience in real life; if water has a continous flow, consistent or not, it eventually pierces through rock and overcomes any obstacles in its way.

The idea is to use milestones as obstacles to a final goal or outcome. Milestones/obstacles that are meant to be tackled and defeated.

Some people might find it hard at first to align with this thought process but it's simple actually: you have to get through each milestone to achieve the end goal; this makes them things in your way of achieving the end goal: that's an obstacle.

There will be guides on how to apply this approach:
- an end goal is the easy part to decide
- breaking it down requires some form of finese in most cases

Reinforcement techniques to be introduced include:
- adding a daily time where user will like to resume "flowing" everyday
- constant reminders to reinforce the desire to achieve their goals especially when the user hasn't clocked in for the day

+ a start page for each day that asks the question "are you ready" or a variant of. And then a button saying "Yes, let us begin" or a variant of

+ a vision board of what life would be like upon achieving said goal

+ task list for each milestone. Recuring and one-time. A clicker that monitors the number of times a recurring task is done each day to ensure user knows how much of it they've done and how much they have left.
- would also help with sending reminders and the like to reinforce and to encourage
